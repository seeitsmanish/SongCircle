# 🎵 SongCircle

SongCircle is a real-time collaborative music platform where users can create or join rooms, queue YouTube Music links, and vote on songs. This app solves the common problem of having only one person control the music in group settings like rooms, gyms, or parties by enabling everyone to participate in creating the playlist.
